Given More Time, I Would Improve...
While the current solution effectively deploys the Node.js application on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) using Terraform, Docker, and TLS, there are several areas that could be improved with more time:

1. Automating Certificate Management
Currently, the TLS certificates are manually generated and stored as a Kubernetes secret.
Improvement: Integrate Let's Encrypt with Cert-Manager for automatic certificate provisioning and renewal.
2. CI/CD Integration
The Docker image build and push process is currently manual.
Improvement: Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD to automatically build, push, and deploy changes.
3. Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
The cluster does not have fine-grained access control for different users.
Improvement: Define RBAC policies to ensure least privilege access for services and users.
4. Graceful Shutdown and Health Checks
The application does not handle graceful shutdowns or health checks effectively.
Improvement:
Implement liveness and readiness probes in Kubernetes.
Handle SIGTERM signals in Node.js to allow for proper cleanup before termination.
5. Multi-Cloud or Multi-Region Deployment
Currently, the application is deployed only in GCP (single region).
Improvement: Extend Terraform to support multi-region or even multi-cloud (AWS, Azure) deployments for high availability.
